# AI_Tasks
In this repo I built and trained various machine Learning and deep learning models on different datasets i.e.: 
- ### Machine Learning topics covered:
  Decsion Tree (I built this model from scratch using ID3 algorithm), Linear Regression model (Implemented from scratch and adding the L1 and l2
  Regularization TECHNIQUES), K-Means, K-Medioids, SVM, PCA (To reduce the dimensionality of the features), Recommender Systems
- ### Deep Learning topics covered:
  Neural Networks (NNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to handle sequential data such as
  (Voices). Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AutoEncoders and Variational AutoEncoder, Transfer Learning, UNet to make segmentation of the images   which used in autonmous car driving.
