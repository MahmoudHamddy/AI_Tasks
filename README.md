In this repo I built and trained various machine Learning and deep learning models on different datasets i.e.:Decsion Tree (I built this model from scratch using ID3 algorithm), Also built Linear Regression model and added the L1 and l2 Regularization TECHNIQUES Neural Networks (NNs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to handle sequential data such as
(Voices). Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).Github
